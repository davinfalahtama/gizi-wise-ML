## GiziWise - Machine Learning Notebook

# Project Overview
GiziWise is an app made by C23-PS450 students for Bangkit 2023 Capstone Project. GiziWise is an application that helps people discover the composition and nutritional content of food and beverages by capturing images through the camera or gallery. These images are then analyzed, providing detailed information about the uploaded pictures within the GiziWise application. Moreover, users can also find articles and recipes for healthy food.

# Dataset Description

We have trained a machine learning model using a comprehensive dataset of processed food images. The dataset was sourced from multiple reliable sources, including Kaggle.com, and additional data was scraped from Google. The dataset consists of a total of 7200 images, covering a wide range of food items, which have been categorized into 20 distinct classes.

The dataset provides:

- A diverse collection of food images for robust training and evaluation of machine learning models.
- Preprocessed images to ensure consistent quality and standardization.

**Dataset Split:**

The dataset has been partitioned into three subsets:

* Training Set: 6000 images specifically curated for model training.
* Testing Set: 600 images reserved for model evaluation and generalization assessment.
* Validation Set: 600 images for fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization.
